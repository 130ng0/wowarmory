Since the Armory pulls its data from the actual game servers, it is the most comprehensive and up-to-date database on the characters, arena teams, guilds, and items of World of Warcraft in existence.

Clicking this tab allows you to log in to the Armory without leaving the current page, and displays a link to the character on the account with the highest relevance as determined by the Armory. You can use the "My Characters" option below this profile link to access the profiles of the other characters on this account. Once logged in, you can access login-protected content for the characters on that account including guild banks and the player calendar.<p></p>Read more about the character selection interface and the login process at our <a href="/faq-login.xml">Armory Login FAQ</a>.
armory_faq_a4 = The World of Warcraft Mobile Armory is a mobile version of World of Warcraft&rsquo;s official searchable database for the iPhone&trade; and iPod touch&reg;.

Find complete details on the <a href="iphone.xml">Mobile Armory page</a>.

On this page will be a list of items that may be considered upgrades for that item and for that particular character. <p></p>These recommended upgrades take into account the character&rsquo;s class, statistics, and overall gear quality. In this manner, you can look for upgrades for your character&rsquo;s items as well as for any other character in World of Warcraft. This feature is also intended to be helpful for characters with multiple gear sets, as they can find upgrades for all their sets. The recommended upgrades feature will produce the most accurate results when used on characters that have no buffs affecting their statistics. <p></p>Read more at our <a href="/faq-item-info-recommended.xml">Find an Upgrade FAQ</a>.
armory_faq_a6 = Similar to a search engine relevance rating, the relevance category attempts to sort the matches to a search with the goal that the most appropriate matches appear near the top of the search results. Relevance is determined by running a combination of factors through an algorithm. These factors are different depending on what category is being searched for. For example, relevancy for a particular character name search may be affected by the level of the character, the last login time of the character, and other factors.
armory_faq_a7 = The Armory supports Internet Explorer (version 6.0 and up), Firefox, Opera 9, Safari, and Chrome, and has been optimized for the most recent versions of each.

faq_guilds_q7 = How do I use the Bank Log?
faq_guilds_q8 = Why can't I view a given guild bank?
faq_guilds_q9 = I moved an item from one tab to another, but to some of my guildies it appears as though an item was deposited or withdrawn from a single tab. What gives?
faq_guilds_q10 = How far back in time do the entries in the Bank Log extend?

faq_guilds_a1 = You can view and search a guild's roster, as well as statistics breaking down the roster. New functionality allows guild members who have been granted access by their guild leader to view and search their guild bank's contents as well as see all the transactions for their guild bank.
faq_guilds_a2 = Clicking on the Guild Roster tab displays a list of the members of the guild, with their level, race and class icons, and guild rank displayed. The top of the page displays the guild's name, tabard, realm, battlegroup, and number of members. This is the default page you access by clicking on a guild name within the Armory. You can sort any of the displayed columns by clicking on the column name, and switch pages by clicking on the arrows at the bottom of the list. New name and level range text fields as well as drop-down menus allow for more streamlined, focused sorting.
faq_guilds_a3 = This page is a statistical breakdown of the guild's roster. You can see how the guild is represented by class, race, level range, and gender. These values are controlled by the drop down menus and text fields near the top of the page. You can also click the matching icons as a shortcut to sort by class or race. If you wish to reset to the default unsorted view, click the "reset" button on the top right of the page.
faq_guilds_a4 = Certain areas of the Armory, such as Guild Banks, require you to log in to access them because of the nature of the information in these areas.
faq_guilds_a5 = You should have access to the Guild Bank pages for approximately two weeks after you log in.
faq_guilds_a6 = <p><span style="color: #FF0000;">There are two tabs devoted to the new Guild Bank system. Attempting to access these tabs will bring up a login window. You need to log in to access the Guild Banks of the characters on that account. Make sure that your account includes a character who is a member of the guild in question, and that your character&rsquo;s guild rank confers guild bank access. Your character must have been granted permission to view each guild bank tab to view the contents of that tab.</span></p><p>The Bank Contents page displays a grid depicting the contents of the character&rsquo;s guild bank, along with a search results section. Here are the features of the page:</p><ul><li>The slots of the grid are labeled with a basic coordinate system which is referenced by the search results below.</li><li>Each guild bank has a maximum of six tabs of storage slots. The default view of the contents page is the first tab of the guild bank that is viewable. To switch between tabs, click the icons below the grid. </li><li>Not all tabs may be displayed, as the guild leader must purchase them in succession for them to become available. </li><li>The search results section below allows you to see the contents of the bank in a sortable list. You can sort the items by name, type, subtype, page, and slot by clicking the column headers, and navigate between results pages with the arrow buttons. </li><li>The &ldquo;Slot&rdquo; column in the results section refers to the coordinates of the bank slot on the grid. </li><li>The drop-down menus are a different method to search for items in the guild bank of a particular quality, type, subtype, and slot. The name search field finds all items in the bank containing the text string you enter. </li><li>Click &ldquo;Reset Filters&rdquo; to restore the default view.</li></ul>
faq_guilds_a7 = <p><span style="color: #FF0000;">Attempting to access this tab will bring up a login window. You need to log in to access the Guild Banks of the characters on that account. Make sure that your account includes a character who is a member of the guild in question, and that your character's guild rank confers the ability to view the guild bank logs.</span></p><p>In the Bank Log, you can view and search the record of every transaction that has occurred within your Guild Bank. Here are the features of the page:</p><ul><li>In the default view, the results section displays all transactions in the most recent &ldquo;group&rdquo; of transactions, sorted by date and time. </li><li>Each group is comprised of over one thousand transactions. Click the arrows above the results to navigate between groups. </li><li>Click the arrows at the bottom right of the results to navigate between pages of results in the group you are viewing. </li><li>The actual transactions you can see in a given group are limited by your guild bank permissions. Thus, it is possible to see far fewer transactions in a given group than actually were recorded during that period of time. </li><li>The results of the group you are viewing can be sorted by name, rank, origin, action, destination, item, and date. </li><li>You can search by character, date, type of transaction, or any combination of the above in your current group of transactions &ndash; narrow your search for fast and efficient results. </li><li>Selecting any of the filters narrows your search in real time &ndash; you should see the list of results instantaneously reflect your selections.</li><li>The two name search fields (for character and item names) find all matches containing the text string you enter.</li><li>The tooltips for items in the Bank Log do not display any permanent enchants or socketed gems that may be on those items.</li><li>Click "Reset Filters" to restore the default view. </li></ul>
faq_guilds_a8 = Please ensure that your World of Warcraft account includes a character who is a member of the guild's bank you are attempting to view, and that your character's guild rank confers guild bank access. If you are a member of the guild and still can't view a guild bank tab or the bank logs, you may not have been granted permission by your guild master to do so. Some guild banks may be suspended due to inactivity.
faq_guilds_a9 = If you are a guild member with access to only one of the two tabs involved in a given item move, you will see the evidence of the move in the item log as either a withdrawal or a deposit depending on whether you have access to the origin tab (withdrawal) or the destination tab (deposit).
faq_guilds_a10 = Every transaction that occurs in your Guild Bank is recorded and searchable in the Armory. However, the transactions are divided into groups, each of which includes a certain number of transactions. You may need to navigate to a different group to find the particular transaction you&rsquo;re searching for. The most recent group is group 1, and older groups are consecutively numbered. Click the buttons below the Bank Log results to navigate between different transaction groups.
faq_guilds_a11 = Most in-game changes to the Guild Bank and Guild Roster should appear on the Armory in the same day.
faq_guilds_a12 = The guild ranks are simply taken from each guild's actual ranking system. The number of each rank corresponds to the equivalent rank tier in the guild's structure; for example, guild leaders are identified as such. Save the guild leader rank, other rank titles are not visible. However, on the Guild Bank pages your guild&rsquo;s actual rank titles will be displayed after logging in to view these pages. They can be seen on the Guild Log page, in both the transaction log itself as well as in the drop-down menu to filter by guild rank.
faq_guilds_a13 = Only characters level 10 and above appear in the Armory, including on guild roster pages.

# faq-arenas
faq_arenas_q1 = What is the Arena Ladder?
faq_arenas_q2 = How are rankings determined?
faq_arenas_q3 = How long is a season?
faq_arenas_q4 = What are the team rank requirements for the end-of-season Arena titles?

faq_arenas_a1 = The Arena Ladder is a competitive ladder system for players participating in team-based player-vs.-player (PvP) combat. The system will rank teams against other teams in one of three brackets: 2-vs.-2, 3-vs.-3, and 5-vs.-5. Teams will earn arena points based on their current team ranking. Accumulated arena points can be used to purchase items and other rewards.
faq_arenas_a2 = Rankings are determined based on your team's wins and losses against similarly ranked teams. Wins against higher ranked teams will increase your ranking while victories against lower ranked teams might yield smaller positive gains. Losing against a lower ranked team will decrease your ranking. The basic idea is similar to the Elo rating system used for professional chess.
faq_arenas_a3 = Each season lasts several months.
faq_arenas_a4 = At the conclusion of each Arena season, team members who played in at least 20% of a highly-ranked Arena team&rsquo;s matches for the season are eligible for special titles commemorating their achievement. These titles persist through the following season. Here are the special titles along with their ranking thresholds:<ul><li>Gladiator: Top 0.5%</li><li>Duelist:  0.5% - 3%</li><li>Rival: 3% - 10%</li><li>Challenger: 10% - 35%</li></ul>In addition, the first-place team in each bracket earns a special title whose name matches that season's arena gear, such as "Brutal Gladiator".

# faq-arenacalc
faq_arenacalc_q1 = What is the Arena Calculator?
faq_arenacalc_q2 = How is my Team Rating calculated?
faq_arenacalc_q3 = How does my Team Rating give me Arena Points?
faq_arenacalc_q4 = What can I purchase with Arena Points, and how many can I have at one time?
faq_arenacalc_q5 = Does .999... = 1?

faq_arenacalc_a1 = The Arena Calculator has three functions. The Points calculator translates a given rating into the number of points it would yield for the week. The Rating calculator takes a given point goal as well as current stockpiled point total into account to generate a table showing average rating needed over time to obtain that goal. The Time calculator also uses a given point goal and current points, but calculates the length of time needed to reach the goal based on the average rating you input.
faq_arenacalc_a2 = A new team&rsquo;s rating is 0, and subsequent wins change this rating. Every time your team wins a match, your rating goes up. The amount by which your rating changes depends on your team's rating compared to the other team's rating.
faq_arenacalc_a3 = At the end of each week, your Team Rating is used to calculate how many Arena Points your team will receive for this week. Your team must have played a minimum of ten matches per week to be rewarded with Arena Points, and a team member must have been in at least 30% of the week&rsquo;s matches to be eligible for that week's points. It is important to note that the points you receive in a given week is determined by only one team, and not by combining all your teams' points. Whichever team you are a member of that would receive the most points after accounting for Team Rating and team type becomes the sole source for your points for that week. Note that 2v2 and 3v3 teams are subject to a handicap where they receive fewer points than a 5v5 team with the same Team Rating.
faq_arenacalc_a4 = Arena Points are used as currency to purchase Arena Rewards. You can stockpile a maximum of 5,000 Arena Points and they do not decay over time.
faq_arenacalc_a5 = <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?040401">Yes</a>.
